AI regulation is being written today, and I help organizations navigate it.

As an **AI Governance & Compliance Research Intern** at IntegrityStudio.ai, I develop cross-border compliance frameworks for enterprise LLM deployments. My background in **International and European Law** (Groningen) and **International Commercial Arbitration** (Stockholm) positions me at the intersection of AI governance and dispute resolution.

**What I bring:** Quadrilingual legal analysis with direct access to primary regulatory sources across EU member states.

## Focus Areas

### AI Governance & The EU AI Act

Legislators are writing the legal frameworks governing AI now, and I want to help shape them. My coursework on the EU AI Act revealed how profoundly AI will transform legal practice, from contract analysis to dispute resolution. This is not a distant future; the AAA-ICDR launched its first AI arbitrator in November 2025, and the ICC has established a Task Force examining AI in arbitration proceedings.

### AI in Dispute Resolution

International arbitration is at an inflection point. The launch of AI-native arbitrators, AI-assisted document review, and predictive analytics tools raises fundamental questions about due process, transparency, and enforceability. My legal training provides the procedural foundation to analyze these questions rigorously.

### Cross-Border Compliance

Legal analysis of AI regulation cannot rely solely on English-language sources. The German Bundestag, Spanish Cortes, and French Assemblée nationale are each shaping how the EU AI Act applies domestically. I can access these primary sources directly, providing analysis that captures nuances lost in translation.

## Languages

| Language | Level | Professional Application |
|----------|-------|-------------------------|
| German | Native | Legal research, regulatory analysis (BaFin, BfDI) |
| Spanish | Native | Compliance documentation, AEPD/CNMV sources |
| English | C2 | Primary working language |
| French | B1 | Reading comprehension for CNIL, regulatory texts |
