## Isabel Budenz

I am an **AI Governance & Compliance Research Intern** at IntegrityStudio.ai, with a foundation in **International and European Law** from the University of Groningen. My work sits at the intersection of **AI governance**, **international dispute resolution**, and **cross-border compliance**.

## Focus Areas

### AI Governance & The EU AI Act

The legal frameworks governing AI are being written now, and I want to help shape them. My coursework on the EU AI Act revealed how profoundly AI will transform legal practice, from contract analysis to dispute resolution. This is not a distant future; the AAA-ICDR launched its first AI arbitrator in November 2025, and the ICC has established a Task Force examining AI in arbitration proceedings.

### AI in Dispute Resolution

International arbitration is at an inflection point. The launch of AI-native arbitrators, AI-assisted document review, and predictive analytics tools raises fundamental questions about due process, transparency, and enforceability. My legal training provides the procedural foundation to analyze these questions rigorously.

### Cross-Border Compliance

Legal analysis of AI regulation cannot rely solely on English-language sources. The German Bundestag, Spanish Cortes, and French Assemblée nationale are each shaping how the EU AI Act applies domestically. I can access these primary sources directly, providing analysis that captures nuances lost in translation.
