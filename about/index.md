AI regulation is being written today—I help organizations navigate it.

As an **AI Governance Research Intern** at [IntegrityStudio.ai](https://integritystudio.ai){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, I develop compliance frameworks for enterprise LLM deployments across jurisdictions. My background in International and European Law (Groningen) and International Commercial Arbitration (Stockholm) positions me at the intersection of AI governance and dispute resolution.

**What I bring:** Quadrilingual legal analysis with direct access to primary regulatory sources across EU member states.

## Focus Areas

### AI Governance & The [EU AI Act](https://artificialintelligenceact.eu){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

Legislators are writing the legal frameworks governing AI now—I want to help shape them.

My coursework on the EU AI Act revealed how profoundly AI is transforming legal practice, from contract analysis to dispute resolution. This is not a distant future: the [AAA-ICDR](https://www.adr.org){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} launched its first AI arbitrator in November 2025, and the [ICC](https://iccwbo.org/dispute-resolution/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} has established a Task Force examining AI in arbitration proceedings.

### AI in Dispute Resolution

International arbitration is at an inflection point. The launch of AI-native arbitrators, AI-assisted document review, and predictive analytics tools raises fundamental questions about due process, transparency, and enforceability. My legal training provides the procedural foundation to analyze these questions rigorously.

### Cross-Border Compliance

Legal analysis of AI regulation cannot rely solely on English-language sources.

The [German Bundestag](https://www.bundestag.de){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, [Spanish Cortes](https://www.congreso.es){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, and [French Assemblée nationale](https://www.assemblee-nationale.fr){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} are each shaping how the EU AI Act applies domestically. I access these primary sources directly, providing analysis that captures nuances lost in translation.

## Career Vision

I'm building a career at the intersection of international dispute resolution and AI governance. Target paths include:

- **Policy organizations:** [European Commission AI Office](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/ai-office){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, IAPS
- **AI companies:** Governance-focused roles at [OpenAI](https://openai.com){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, [Jus Mundi](https://jusmundi.com){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, or similar

Whether advising companies on compliance, helping arbitral institutions adapt to technological change, or contributing to policy development, I see legal expertise as essential to ensuring AI benefits society broadly.
