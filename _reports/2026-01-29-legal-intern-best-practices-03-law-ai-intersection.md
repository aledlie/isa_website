The intersection of law and AI presents numerous opportunities for impactful project work.

## 3.1 EU AI Act Compliance

The [EU AI Act](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/regulatory-framework-ai) is the first comprehensive legal framework on AI worldwide, creating significant opportunities for legal professionals:

**Key Compliance Milestones**
- February 2025: Prohibitions became effective
- August 2025: Key obligations binding; penalty regime in effect
- Ongoing: Implementation of transparency and documentation requirements

**Compliance Actions Requiring Legal Expertise**
- Establishing AI inventory with risk classification
- Clarifying company roles (supplier, modifier, or deployer)
- Preparing technical and transparency documentation
- Implementing copyright and data protection requirements
- Training employees on AI competence requirements
- Adapting internal governance structures

**Penalties for Non-Compliance**
- Up to EUR 35 million or 7% of global annual turnover for prohibited AI practices
- Up to EUR 15 million or 3% for certain other obligations

## 3.2 AI Ethics and Governance

**Key Frameworks**
- [UNESCO Recommendation on the Ethics of AI](https://www.unesco.org/en/artificial-intelligence/recommendation-ethics): First global standard, applicable to 194 member states
- [NIST AI Risk Management Framework](https://www.nist.gov/itl/ai-risk-management-framework)
- [Microsoft Responsible AI Standard](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/responsible-ai): Six principles (fairness, reliability, inclusiveness, privacy, transparency, accountability)

**Project Areas**
- Algorithmic auditing frameworks
- Bias mitigation strategies
- Transparency and explainability mechanisms
- Human oversight protocols
- AI impact assessments

## 3.3 Data Privacy and AI

The intersection of data protection and AI presents numerous project opportunities:

- GDPR "right to explanation" for AI decision-making
- Data quality and protection in AI training
- Cross-border data transfer issues
- Privacy-by-design for AI systems
- Consent mechanisms for AI-processed data

## 3.4 AI in International Arbitration

Given backgrounds in International Commercial Arbitration, this is a particularly relevant area:

**Recent Developments**
- [AAA-ICDR AI Arbitrator](https://www.adr.org/press-releases/aaa-icdr-to-launch-ai-native-arbitrator-transforming-dispute-resolution/): Launched November 2025 for documents-only construction cases
- [ICC Commission Task Force](https://www.whitecase.com/insight-our-thinking/2025-international-arbitration-survey-arbitration-and-ai): Launched 2025 to consider AI use in arbitration
- [Silicon Valley Arbitration & Mediation Center Guidelines](https://svamc.org/): Standardized methods for handling AI in arbitration

**Project Opportunities**
- AI applications in arbitrator selection
- Predictive analytics for case outcomes
- AI-assisted evidence collection and review
- Ethical guidelines for AI in arbitration proceedings
- Cross-jurisdictional AI governance in dispute resolution

## 3.5 Algorithmic Accountability
