## Before: Original Content

The initial document was a functional but minimal reference guide.

```markdown
---
layout: single
title: "How This Site Works"
author_profile: true
toc: true
toc_label: "Contents"
toc_sticky: true
---

This site uses Jekyll with the Minimal Mistakes theme, the same foundation
as [Sumedh's original blog](https://www.sumedhmjoshi.com/). This guide
covers creating and managing content.

## Quick Reference

For detailed theme documentation, see the original theme setup guide:
- [Theme Setup - sumedhmjoshi.com](https://www.sumedhmjoshi.com/theme-setup/)

## Creating Content with Octopress

Octopress provides convenient commands for creating new posts and pages
with proper front matter.

### New Post

\`\`\`bash
octopress new post "Your Post Title" --dir posts
\`\`\`

This creates a new file in `_posts/` with the current date and slugified title.

### New Page

\`\`\`bash
octopress new page page-name/
\`\`\`

This creates a new page at the specified path.

## Front Matter

Every content file needs YAML front matter at the top. Here's a typical post:

\`\`\`yaml
---
layout: single
title: "Post Title"
date: 2025-01-29
categories: [analysis]
tags: [data, visualization]
author_profile: true
---
\`\`\`

## Content Collections

| Collection | Location | Purpose |
|------------|----------|---------|
| Posts | `_posts/` | Blog posts (YYYY-MM-DD-title.md) |
| Projects | `_projects/` | Portfolio items |
| Reports | `_reports/` | Technical reports |
| Work | `_work/` | Work-in-progress |

## Local Development

\`\`\`bash
bundle install && npm install
npm run serve
npm run build
\`\`\`

## Customization

Colors and fonts are defined in `_sass/variables.scss`.

## Testing Before Deploy

\`\`\`bash
npm run test:all
\`\`\`
```

### Issues Identified

| Issue | Severity | Category |
|-------|----------|----------|
| Generic title ("How This Site Works") | Medium | SEO |
| No excerpt/meta description | Medium | SEO |
| Opening references external site without context | Low | Readability |
| Octopress used without explanation | High | Usability |
| No output examples after commands | Medium | Actionability |
| Missing navigation configuration | High | Completeness |
| Missing draft workflow | Medium | Completeness |
| Missing troubleshooting section | High | Completeness |
| No deployment information | Medium | Completeness |
| No image management guidance | Low | Completeness |

## After: Improved Content

The revised document addresses all identified issues with expanded sections and improved SEO.

```markdown
---
layout: single
title: "Jekyll Site Maintenance Guide"
excerpt: "Step-by-step guide for creating posts, pages, and managing
content on a Jekyll/Minimal Mistakes personal site."
author_profile: true
toc: true
toc_label: "Contents"
toc_sticky: true
---

This guide covers creating and managing content on this Jekyll site,
which uses the Minimal Mistakes theme. Whether you're adding a new
blog post, updating navigation, or troubleshooting build errors,
you'll find the steps here.

## Creating Content with Octopress

[Octopress](https://github.com/octopress/octopress) is a Ruby gem that
scaffolds Jekyll content with proper file naming and front matter.
Install it with `gem install octopress`.

### New Post

\`\`\`bash
octopress new post "Your Post Title" --dir posts
\`\`\`

**What it does:** Creates a new file in `_posts/` with the current
date and slugified title.

**Output:** `_posts/2025-01-29-your-post-title.md`

**Verify:** Check that the file exists with `ls _posts/`.

## Working with Drafts

Store unpublished posts in `_drafts/`. Drafts don't require a date
in the filename.

Preview drafts locally:

\`\`\`bash
npm run serve -- --drafts
\`\`\`

## Managing Navigation

Edit `_data/navigation.yml` to add or remove menu items:

\`\`\`yaml
main:
  - title: "Blog"
    url: /posts/
  - title: "Projects"
    url: /projects/
\`\`\`

## Troubleshooting

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| "Liquid syntax error" | Unescaped double braces | Wrap in raw/endraw |
| "Invalid date" | Wrong filename format | Use YYYY-MM-DD-title.md |
| Styles not updating | Cached assets | Delete _site/ and rebuild |
| Port 4000 in use | Another server running | Kill process on port |
