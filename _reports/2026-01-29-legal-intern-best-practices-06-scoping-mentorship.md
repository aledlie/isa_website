Effective project scoping and mentorship are critical to intern success and project outcomes.

## 6.1 Effective Project Scoping

**Principles**
- *"Reduce scope rather than compromise on good development practices"*
- Ensure tasks are appropriately challenging without being overwhelming
- Build in flexibility for unexpected complexity
- Communicate transparently about delays or scope changes

**Scoping Framework**

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Problem Statement | Clear articulation of the challenge or need |
| Objectives | Specific, measurable goals |
| Deliverables | Concrete outputs expected |
| Timeline | Realistic schedule with milestones |
| Resources | Tools, data, and support available |
| Success Criteria | How outcomes will be evaluated |
| Constraints | Limitations and boundaries |

## 6.2 Mentorship Best Practices

**Setting Clear Expectations**

- Provide access to subject matter experts
- Create opportunities for networking and exposure
- Offer feedback that is specific, actionable, and timely

## 6.3 Program Design Elements
